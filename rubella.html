    <h3>Rubella is a disease caused by the rubella virus, which is an enveloped RNA virus. The virus is transmitted through the air. It can lead to a rash and fever. Rubella can often lead to arthritis and joint pain in adults and children. Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is perhaps the biggest fear. CRS can lead to fetal death, premature delivery, congenital effects, and deafness. Therefore it is essential to be vaccinated against rubella. The rubella vaccine (RA 27/3) is often combined with measles and mumps to make the MMR vaccine. RA 27/3 is a live attenuated virus, meaning that the virus is still alive but its disease causing functions have been eliminated. The rubella vaccine confers lifelong immunity and is efficacious 95% of the time. The first MMR shot should be administered when the child is around 12 months of age. The second dose of the MMR shot should be administered at around the age of 4-6. Extensive cohort studies have demonstrated that the MMR vaccine does not induce autism.
