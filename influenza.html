    <h1>Influenza</h1> 
    <br>
    <h3>Influenza is a highly infectious disease caused by a segmented, single-stranded RNA virus. The influenza virus has hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface antigens; this diversity of antigen types creates many types of influenza strains (one example is H1N1). There are also three types of influenza viruses: type A, B, and C. Type A and B are found in humans; Type A causes the most severe disease. Developing a vaccine to the influenza virus is very challenging because of changes to its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens. There are two types of changes: antigenic shift and antigenic drift. Antigenic drift is caused by changes on the DNA level (point mutations) that can create a new subtype of influenza virus. This happens naturally due to errors in DNA replication. Antigenic shift is when there is an exchange of gene segments between different strains of influenza virus that can also lead to new subtypes of influenza. Influenza can spread through the air. Common signs of influenza include fever, cough, headache, and sore throat. Some complications of influenza include pneumonia and death. According to the Centers for Disease Control, influenza has killed anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 people per year. The elderly are especially vulnerable, making up 37% of influenza related hospitalizations and 90% of deaths. The cost of influenza epidemics could be as high as $12 billion.

    There are two types of influenza vaccines in the US: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). In the past, these vaccines have been trivalent, which means that there are three different influenza strains in the vaccine. Usually it includes two type A strains and one type B strain. Since 2013, quadrivalent vaccines have been introduced, providing protection against 4 strains. Quadrivalent vaccines include two type A strains and two type B strains. The inactivated influenza vaccine is the most common vaccine that is used; it is about 60% effective in patients under the age of 65. For different age groups there are different approved vaccines. For example, if you are 65 years and older you should use Fluzone High Dose. An alternative to IIV is LAIV. It is approved for use in patients between the age of 2 and 49 and is administered intranasally. It is recommended that everyone over 6 months of age gets an annual influenza vaccine. Generally vaccination starts in October and ends around late March.

    Herd immunity is very hard to achieve because of the low efficacy of the influenza vaccine. Because public health experts have to anticipate and predict which virus will be prevalent each year, not every prediction will be accurate. Therefore, some strains of influenza that might circulate will not be vaccinated against. Because of the low efficacy of influenza vaccine, large proportions of the population need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Especially in the US, more people need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity to reduce cost and provide protection for those who might not be able to receive the vaccine, especially among the elderly.
