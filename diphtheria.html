    <h3>Diphtheria is a disease caused by the toxins released by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The released toxin can lead to the decay of tissues; the toxin can also cause other diseases like decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and abnormal heart rhythms (myocarditis). Symptoms of diphtheria include fatigue, fever, sore throat, and a white membrane forming on the tonsils. About 5-10% of people who contract diphtheria die; this number can increase to up to 20% in children and older adults. Diphtheria is usually treated with antibiotics or antitoxin, compounds that either kill the bacteria or neutralize the toxin. DTaP, Td, and Tdap are the most common forms of diphtheria vaccines. These vaccines are around 95% effective. Four doses of DTaP are given at around 2, 4, 6, and 15 months. If the 4th DTaP dose is given before the child is 4 years old, a 5th dose (or a booster dose is recommended when the child is between the ages of 4-6. Depending on the age of the child, the booster shot could be DTap, Tdap, or Td. Between the ages of 4-6, children should get DTap. It is recommended by the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) that a child between 11 and 12 they should get vaccinated with Tdap. From this point on the patient should get a Td vaccine every 10 years as a booster shot.
